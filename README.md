### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

This is my first repository, that I created because Iâ€™m currently learning about GitHub in the course <a href="https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:IBM+CD0131EN+3T2022/home">"Git and Github Basics"</a>, by IBM, available on <a href="https://home.edx.org/">EDX</a>. ğŸŒ± Have a nice day!
